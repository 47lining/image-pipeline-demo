# eb-py-flask-signup-worker
This Python sample application illustrates the worker role functionality of AWS Elastic Beanstalk. It is designed to process messages generated by the orchestrator. Messages contain a date, and the worker app reads a specification and (potentially) generates an image.

## Message Format
To test the worker app without the frontend, you can manually enqueue messages of the following format:

    {
        "key" : "long_random_string",
        "date" : "2015-04-15 00:00:00"
    }

## IAM Role Permissions
The worker role must run in an IAM role with permissions to S3 and SQS.
